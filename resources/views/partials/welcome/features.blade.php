              Industrial Hazardous Waste Treatment
            </h3>

            <p>
              The facility is designed for the treatment of solid and liquid hazardous waste that contains large amount of organic pollutants.
              It utilizes physical - chemical treatment, an approach including phase seperation, such as through filtration, solidification into hard material
              allowing for landfill disposal and thermal hazardous waste treatment which is high temparature oxidation of wastes that converts them into gases and solid residues.

              Wastewater Treatment
            </h3>

            <p>
              Wastewater treatment processes require careful management to ensure the protection of the water body that receives the discharge. We use physical,
              biological and chemical treatment to clean wastewater. This is accomplished by biological oxidation of organic compounds present in the system through microbial activity enhanced by well maintained aeration, pH, temperature. The seperation and settling of activated sludge solids is also incorporated in the process to create an acceptable quality of wastewater effluent.

              Destruction for Non-Toxic Materials
            </h3>

            <p>
              Destruction of non-hazardous materials usually consists of expired consumer products and packaging. Such materials are destructed using crusher and other simple unit operations including size reduction and heat transfer with no chemical reactions. Treated materials are ready for disposal to landfill. Recyclable containers are manually destructed for recovery.
